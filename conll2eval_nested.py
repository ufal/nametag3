"""
Prints the (nested) named entities for evaluation.

Input:
------

A CoNLL file with linearized (encoded) nested named entity labels delimited
with '|' (the output of NameTag 3 or the gold CoNLL file).

Output:
-------

One entity per line, three columns per line separated by tab:
    - first column are entity token ids separated by comma,
    - second column is the BIO or BILOU label,
    - the third column are the tokens separated by comma.

The output can be then evaluated with 'compare_nested_entities.py' against the
entities printed from the gold data.
