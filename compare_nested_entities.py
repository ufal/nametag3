"""
Computes strict span-based nested F1.

The input nested entities are supposed to be in the following format:

One entity per line, three columns per line separated by tab:
    - first column are entity token ids separated by comma,
    - second column is the BIO or BILOU label,
    - the third column are the tokens separated by comma.

Use the script 'conll2eval_nested.py' to print (nested) named entities from the
CoNLL file, e.g., the NameTag 3 predicted output.
